Web design for ITEC 3020
In this assignment, you are asked to create a product page in an online shop using
proper HTML and CSS. The use of CSS to style your websites in a way itâ€™s appealing to
the user is very important.
Your assignment should include:
- A sketch of the web page you made before you start making your webpage
- One index.html file
- One or more css files
- The pictures, more html files, or other files you might have referenced in your
html file.
- A text file with the names of the teammates
Your page should include:
- Logo and name of the online shop
- At least one picture of the product
- Some text to describe the product
- A list pointing out different characteristics of the product
- Buttons to choose between different variations of the product in terms of color,
size, model, etc (based on the product you choose to present)
- A button to add the product to the cart
- A button to view the cart
- A search field for searching for new items
- A navigation bar to navigate to other pages (or at least the main page of the
shop)
- A section promoting similar/suggested products
- the buttons do not do anything, they are just there to show(and in the future when
the functionalities are implemented, select) the different models a product might
have
